Here I am baby. You got my future in your hands, hey. I've done a lot of foolish things. That I really didn't mean, ah. Yeah, yeah, didn't I, woah baby. Seen a lot of things in this old world. When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl. Ooh baby, here I am. Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, oh, I'm yours. Ooh, baby, you set my soul on fire. That's why I know you're my heart's only desire. Ooh baby, here I am. Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, ah. Here I am baby, woah. You got my future in your hands, ah. Here I am baby, I. You got my future in your hands, baby. I've done a lot of foolish things. That I really didn't mean. I could be a broken a man, but here I am. Here I am baby. Ah, here I am baby. Here I am baby. Get it, get it, get it, get it. Here I am baby. Yeah, baby.
