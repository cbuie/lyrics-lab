Appel-Cretecos-Farrell. I go downtown and roam around. But every street I walk I find another dead end. I'm on my own but I'm so all alone. I need somebody so I won't have to pretend. I know that someone's just waiting somewhere. I look around for her but she's just not there, oh. Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me ? Where are you ? Doesn't somebody want to wanted like me, just like me ? I'm runnin' free but I don't want to be. I couldn't take another day like yesterday. I'm dead on my feet from walkin' the street. I need somebody to help me find my way. I've gotta get out of this town. Before I do I'll take a last look around though. Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me ? Where are you ? Doesn't somebody want to wanted like me, just like me ? You know, I'm no different than anybody else. I start each day and end each night. It gets really lonely when you're by yourself. And where is love ? And who is love ? I gotta know. Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me ? Where are you ? Doesn't somebody want to wanted like me, just like me ? Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me ? Where are you ? Doesn't somebody want to wanted like me, just like me ?.
