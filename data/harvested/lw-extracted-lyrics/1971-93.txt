If my love won't pull you up. And my kisses won't check your stuff. Don't be afraid to let me know. 'Bout other places, baby, that I can go. If you don't like it, don't knock it. Somebody help, and don't rock it. If you don't need it, don't waste it. Somebody help, and don't erase it. Oh baby, oh baby. It's for real, don't turn you on. And my will is much too strong. Don't waste my time with your foolish ways. I've got other things to do with my days. Goin' up, movin' down. Goin' up, all the way around town. Up for once that turn you on. I'm the same one to leave you alone. Don't knock my love, don't knock my love. Don't knock my love, baby, don't knock my love. Good goin', fine, it's all right. Don't knock my love, don't knock my love.
