We wrote on the corner of the table. This is the only one that will last. For you, for me, for always. Forever was made for us, but for us it went by too fast. Don't say you don't remember. I'll never love anyone else. If you say you don't remember. How can I go on living (how can I go on living) with myself? When we meet you always call me "baby" (baby). How could it be that you forgot my name? Before you go, be honest. I belonged to you and believed that you felt the same. Don't say you don't remember. I'll never love anyone else. If you say you don't remember. How can I go on living (how can I go on living) with myself? People never stay the same forever. Somebody always loves a little more. Tonight I need to love you. Together we'll find a way to make tomorrow worth living for. Don't say you don't remember. I'll never love anyone else. If you say you don't remember. How can I go on living (how can I go on living). Oh, don't say you don't remember. I'll never love anyone else. If you say you don't remember. How can I go on living (how can I go on living) with myself? (Don't say you don't remember).
