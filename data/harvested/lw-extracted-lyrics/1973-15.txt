Me and Mrs. Jones. We've got a thing going on. We both know that it's wrong. But it's much too strong. To let it go now. We meet everyday at the same café. 6:30 and no one knows she'll be there. Holding hands, making all kinds of plans. While the jukebox play our favorite song. Me and Mrs. Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones. We've got a thing going on. We both know that it's wrong. But it's much too strong. To let it go now. We've gotta be extra careful. That we don't build our hopes up too high. 'Cause she's got her own obligations. And so and so do I. Me and Mrs. Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones. We've got a thing going on. We both know that it's wrong. But it's much too strong. To let it go now. Well, it's time for us to be leaving. It hurts so much, it hurts so much inside. Now she'll go her way and I'll go mine. Tomorrow we'll meet the same place, the same time. Me and Mrs. Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones. We've got a thing going on. We've gotta be extra careful. We can't afford to build our hopes up too high. I wanna meet and talk with you. At the same place, the same café, the same time. And we're gonna hold hands like we used to. We're gonna talk it over, talk it over. We know, they know and you know and I know that it was wrong. But I'll make it strong. We've gotta let 'em know now. We've got a thing going on, thing going on.
