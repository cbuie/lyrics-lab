We were very happy. Well at least I thought we were. Can't somebody tell me. What's got into her. A house, a home, a family. And a man who loves her so. Who'd believe she'd leave us. To join a burlesque show? Say has anybody seen my. Sweet Gypsy Rose? Here's her picture when she was my. Sweet Mary Jo. Now she's got rings on her fingers. And bells on her toes. Say has anybody seen my. Sweet gypsy Rose? Oh, I know when Mary Jo's been dancin'. Here in New Orleans. In this smoke-filled honky-tonk. They call the land of dreams. Whoah, here she comes a-struttin'. In her birthday clothes. Say has anybody seen my. Sweet gypsy Rose? Whoah, baby, baby, Won'tcha come home. Say, we all miss ya. And every night we kiss your picture. Whoiah Rose, one night the lights go dim, And the crowd goes home. That's the day you wake up. And you find you're all alone. So let's say goodbye to Gypsy. Hello Mary Jo. Say has anybody seen my. Sweet Gypsy Rose. So take those rings off your fingers. And bells off your toes. Say has anybody seen my. Now you know just what I mean by. Has anybody seen my Sweet Gypsy Rose.
