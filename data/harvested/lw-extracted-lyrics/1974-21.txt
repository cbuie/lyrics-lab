The marchin' band came down along Main Street. The soldier blues fell in behind. I looked across and there I saw Billy. Waiting to go and join the line. And with her head upon his shoulder. His young and lovely fiancée. From where I stood I saw she was cryin'. And through her tears I heard her say. Billy, don't be a hero. Don't be a fool with your life. Billy, don't be a hero. Come back and make me your wife. And as he started to go. She said, Billy keep your head low. Billy, don't be hero. Come back to me. The soldier blues were trapped on a hillside. The battle raging all around. The sergeant cried, "We've got to hang on boys! We've got to hold this piece of ground. I need a volunteer to ride up. And bring us back some extra men.". And Billy's hand was up in a moment. Forgettin' all the words she said. She said. Billy, don't be a hero. Don't be a fool with your life. Billy, don't be a hero. Come back and make me your wife. And as he started to go. She said Billy, keep your head low. Billy, don't be a hero. Come back to me. I heard his fiancée got a letter. That told how Billy died that day. The letter said that he was a hero. She should be proud he died that way. I heard she threw the letter away.
