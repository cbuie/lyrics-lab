Hello? Hi, honey, it's me. I went to see the doctor today. 'Cause ever since you've been gone. I had had a pain deep down inside. He said there's nothing really wrong with me. I'm just missing my man. So, honey, please come on home as soon as you can. Doctor's orders say. There's only one thing for me. Nothing he can do. 'Cause only you can cure me. Says in my condition. Love's the best physician. He's prescribed a potion. Full of warm emotion. Every day. A loving spoonful to be taken. It's the only way. To stop this empty heart of mine from breaking. Won't get better till. You're back again, he told me. Doctor's orders. I need your loving arms to hold me. Darling now I know. There ain't no doubt about it. I'm so hooked on your love. I can't live without it. You're away. But please don't treat me like a stranger. Doctor's orders say. One kiss from you and I am out of danger. Please say you understand how I feel, honey. I know you've got a lot of things on your mind. Oh, but I'm missing you so bad. Please, oh, please come on home. Doctor's orders say. There's only one thing for me. Nothing he can do.
