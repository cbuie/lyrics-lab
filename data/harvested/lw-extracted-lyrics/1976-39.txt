Lonely Night, I cry myself to sleep. Tell me, what am I gonna do.  'Cause it's always been you to dry my tears. It's always been you to wash away my fears. It's always been you each night and day. Now what can I say when love slips away? Lonely night, I'm walking the floor. Tell me, what am I gonna do. Without your precious love, your tender touch. Hey, Little Girl, I miss you so much. Wish we could turn back the hands of time. To the day when you were mine. You used to call me Angel Face. Used to call me Angel Face. You used to help me through the night. Make me feel all right. Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night.  I can't get ya out of my mind. I can't get ya out of my mind. I can't get ya out of my mind. I promise you I'll change my ways. I promise you love's here to stay. Hey, Little Girl, depend on me.  I'll be yours for eternity. You used to call me Angel Face. Used to call me Angel Face. You used to help me through the night. Make me feel all right. Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night. You used to call me Angel Face. Used to call me Angel Face. You used to help me through the night. Make me feel all right. Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night. I can't get ya out of my mind. I can't get ya out of my mind. I can't get ya out of my mind. I can't get ya out of my mind. I can't get ya out of my mind. I can't get ya out of my mind.
