Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Madman drummers bummers. Indians in the summer. With a teenage diplomat. In the dumps with the mumps. As the adolescent pumps. His way into his hat. With a boulder on my shoulder. Feeling kinda older. I tripped a merry-go-round. With this very unpleasing. Sneezing and wheezing. The calliope crashed to the ground. The calliope crashed to the ground. Oh, she was blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Some silicone sister. With her manager mister. Told me I've got what it takes. She said. "I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong. Play the song with the funky break". And go-kart Mozart. Was checking out the weather chart. To see if it was safe outside. And little Early Pearly. Came by in his curly wurly. And asked me if I needed a ride. Asked me if I needed a ride. 'Cause she was blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. She got down but she never got tight. She's gonna make it to the night. She's gonna make it through the night. But mama, that's where the fun is. But mama, that's where the fun is. Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun. But mama, that's where the fun is. Some brimstone baritone. Anticyclone rolling stone. Preacher from the east. Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone. Hit it in its funny bone. That's where they expect it least". And some new mown chaperone. Was standing in the corner. Watching the young girls dance. And some fresh-sown moonstone. Was messing with his frozen zone. Reminding him of romance. The calliope crashed to the ground. 'Cause she was blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Wrapped up like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Madman drummers bummers. Indians in the summer. With a teenage diplomat. In the dumps with the mumps. As the adolescent pumps. His way into his hat. With a boulder on my shoulder. Feeling kinda older. I tripped a merry-go-round. With this very unpleasing. Sneezing and wheezing. The calliope crashed to the ground. Now Scott with a slingshot. Finally found a tender spot. And throws his lover in the sand. And some bloodshot forget-me-not. Said, "Daddy's within earshot. Save the buckshot and turn up the band". Some silicone sister. With her manager mister. Told me I've got what it takes. She said, "I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong". She got down but she never got tight. She's gonna make it through the night.
