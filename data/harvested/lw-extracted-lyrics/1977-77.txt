Sailin' away on the crest of a wave. It's like magic. Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and sliding. It's magic. And you and your sweet desire. You took me, oh, higher and higher baby. It's a livin' thing. It's a terrible thing to lose. It's a givin' thing. What a terrible thing to lose. I'm takin' a dive. Dive. Making believe this is what you've conceived. From your worst day. Moving in line when you look back in time. To the first day. And you and your sweet desire. Taking me, oh, higher and higher baby. It's a livin' thing. It's a terrible thing to lose. It's a givin' thing. What a terrible thing to lose. I'm takin' a dive. All the same. Hey. Takin' a dive 'cause you can't halt the slide. Floating downstream. So let her go, don't start spoiling the show. It's a bad dream. And you and your sweet desire. Taking me, oh, higher and higher baby. It's a livin' thing. It's a terrible thing to lose. It's a givin' thing. What a terrible thing to lose. It's a livin' thing. It's a terrible thing to lose. It's a givin' thing. What a terrible thing to lose.
