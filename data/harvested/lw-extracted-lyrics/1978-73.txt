Said the fight to make ends meet. Keeps a man upon his feet. Holding down his job. Trying to show he can't be bought. It takes every kinda people. To make what life's about. Every kinda people. To make the world go 'round. Someone's looking for a lead. In his duty to a king or to a creed. Protecting what he feels is right. Fights against wrong with his life. There is no profit in deceit. Honest men know that. Revenge does not taste sweet. Whether yellow, black, or white. Each and every man's the same inside. It takes every kinda people. To make what life's about. It takes every kinda people. To make the world go 'round. You know that love's the only goal. That could bring a peace to any soul. And every man's the same. He wants the sunshine in his name. It takes every kinda people. To make what life's about. It takes every kinda people. To make the world go 'round. Every kinda people. To make what life's about. It takes every kinda people. To make the world go 'round.
