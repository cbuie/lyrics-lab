Don’t look back, a new day is breakin’. It’s been too long since I felt this way. I don’t mind where I get taken. The road is callin’, today is the day. And I can see it took so long. Just to realize I’m much too strong not to comprimise. Now I see what I am is holding me down. I’ll turn it around. Oho, yes, I will. I finally see the dawn arrivin’. I see beyond the road I’m drivin’. It’s a bright horizon and I’m awakin’. I see myself in a brand new way. The sun is shinin’, the clouds are breakin’. ’Cause I can’t lose now, there’s no game to play. I can tell there’s no more time left to criticize. I’ve seen what I could not recognize. Everthing in my life was leading me on. But I can be strong. Oh, yes, I can! I finally see the dawn arrivin’. I see beyond the road I’m drivin’. Ooohooo, far away and left behind. Left behind. Don’t look back, a new day is breakin’. It’s been so long since I felt this way. I don’t mind where I get taken. The road is callin’, today is the day. And I can see it took so long. Just to realize I’m much too strong not to comprimise. Now I see what I am is holding me down. I’ll turn it around. Oho, yes, I will. I finally see the dawn arrivin’. I see beyond the road I’m drivin’. Far away and left behind. Don't look back. Ooohooohooo. Don't look back. Ooohooohooo. Don't look back. Ooohooohooo. Don't look back. Ooohooohooo.
