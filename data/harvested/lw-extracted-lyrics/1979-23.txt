Our love is alive and so we begin. Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table,stumblin'in. Our love is a flame burnin' within. Now and then fire light will catch us, stumblin'in. Wherever you go, whatever you do. You know these reckless thoughts of mine are followin' you. I've fallen for you, whatever you do. 'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I never knew. Whatever it takes, baby, I'll do it for you. You were so young, ah, but I was so free. I may have been young but baby, that's not what I wanted to be. Well you were the one. Oh why was it me?. 'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I'd never seen. Whatever you need, baby, you got it from me. Ah, stumblin' in, mmm, stumblin' in. Now and then fire light will catch us, stumblin'in. Oh, stumblin' in, I'm stumblin' in. Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table, stumblin'in.
