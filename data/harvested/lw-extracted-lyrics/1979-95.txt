Now come on, take a chance, you're old enough to. Dance the night away. Woah, come on baby, dance the night away. A live wire, barely a beginner. But just watch that lady go. She's on fire 'cause dancing gets her higher. Than anything else she knows. Ooh. Won't you turn your head my way? Ooh. Well don't skip romance, 'cause you're old enough to. Dance the night away. Woah, come on baby, dance the night away. Oh, oh yeah. Hey hey, yeah. Ah, come on baby. Hey hey, yeah. Uh, come on baby, baby. Ooh ooh, yeah. Ah, ha ow.
