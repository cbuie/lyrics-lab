Too many long conversations. And no one is hearin a word. Just tryin to escape the frustrations. Till a song in the night can be heard. Put on your dancin shoes. Throw out those one-night blues. Heres one to love and to chance. For a spin on that wheel of romance. Too slow to unriddle your problems. Too lonely for someone to care. Long, lonely silence keeps haunting. Till the song in the night finds you there. Put on your dancin shoes. Throw out those one-night blues. And her.
