Look out behind you. Jojo's got his gun. He wouldn't mean to do but. Ya know he likes his fun. Jojo dig those spinning lights. Way out games and dizzy heights below him. Jojo dig those Broadway nights. Flashy lines, you know him. He's got you covered. You'll know it right our front. Hey fifty dollars. He'll get you all you want. Jojo dig those spinning lights. Way out games and dizzy heights below him. Jojo dig those Broadway nights. Flashy lines, you know him. Ever so rarely that man in a millon's born. Gentle and soft, but who'd just as soon off you. For looking the wrong way as not. Jojo, go Jo. His baby stays high. Got to keep her sweet. He keeps her just right. Keeps her on the street. Jojo dig those spinning lights. Way out games and dizzy heights below him. Jojo dig those Broadway nights. Oh, you know him. Do you know you are so nice. Do you care. I'd love to take you home. Jojo dig those spinning lights. Way out games and dizzy heights below him..Broadway nights. you know him. Say, what do you think of gentlemen wearing mink. Gentle and soft, but who'd just as soon off you. For looking the wrong way as not. Jojo, go Jo. Jojo.our love can grow. Jojo, now now now.
