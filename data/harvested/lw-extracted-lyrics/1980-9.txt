What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?. Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?. Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound. Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me. What's the matter with the car I'm driving?. Should I get a set of white wall tires?. Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk. It's still rock and roll to me. Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers. 'Cause it's always been the same old scene. There's a new band in town. But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine. Aimed at your average teen. How about a pair of pink sidewinders. And a bright orange pair of pants?. Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways. It's still rock and roll to me. Wooh, wooh. Ooh, what's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?. Should I try to be a straight A student?. It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways. It's still rock and roll to me. Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound. Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me.
