Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. And the days go by like a strand in the wind. In the web that is my own, I begin again. I said to my friend, baby, nothing else mattered. He was no more than a baby then. Well, he seemed broken-hearted. Something within him. But the moment that I first laid. Eyes on him. All alone on the edge of. Seventeen. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. Well, I went today, maybe I will go again tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, well, the music there. Well, it was hauntingly familiar. Well, I see you doing what I try to do for me. With the words from a poet and a voice from a choir. And a melody. And nothing else mattered. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. The clouds never expect it when it rains. But the sea changes colors. But the sea does not change. So with the slow, graceful flow of age. I went forth with an age-old desire to please. On the edge of seventeen. Ooh. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. Well, then suddenly. There was no one left standing in the hall. Yeah, yeah, in a flood of tears that. No one really ever heard fall at all. Well, I went searchin' for an answer. Up the stairs and down the hall. A-not to find an answer, just to hear the call. Of a night bird. Singing "Come away" (Come away). Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. Well, I hear you in the morning. And I hear you at nightfall. And sometime to be near you. Is to be unable to hear you, my love. I'm a few years older than you. (I'm a few years older than you) My love. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh. Just like the white winged dove sings a song. Sounds like she's singing. Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh.
