. Dōmo arigatō misutā Robotto. Mata au hi made. Dōmo arigatō misutā Robotto. Himitsu wo shiritai. You're wondering who I am. Machine or mannequin. With parts made in Japan. I am the modern man. I've got a secret I've been hiding. Under my skin. My heart is human, my blood is boiling. My brain IBM. So if you see me acting strangely. Don't be surprised. I'm just a man who needed someone. And somewhere to hide. To keep me alive. Just keep me alive. Somewhere to hide. To keep me alive. I'm not a robot without emotions. I'm not what you see. I've come to help you with your problems. So we can be free. I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior. Forget what you know. I'm just a man whose circumstances. Went beyond his control. Beyond my control. We all need control. I need control. We all need control. I am the modern man. Who hides behind a mask. So no one else can see. My true identity. Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto. Dōmo. Dōmo. Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto. Dōmo. Dōmo. Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto. Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto. Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto. Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto. Thank you very much, oh, Mr. Roboto. For doing the jobs that nobody wants to. And thank you very much, oh, Mr. Roboto. For helping me escape just when I needed to. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I want to thank you. Please, thank you. Oh, ya. The problem's plain to see. Too much technology. Machines to save our lives. Machines dehumanize. The time has come at last. To throw away this mask. Now everyone can see. My true identity. I'm Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy!.
