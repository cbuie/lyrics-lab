I'm outta luck, outta love. Got a photograph, picture of. Passion killer, you're too much. You're the only one I wanna touch. I see your face every time I dream. On every page, every magazine. So wild and free, so far from me. You're all I want, my fantasy. Oh, look what you've done to this rock and roll clown. Oh-oh, look what you've done. I don't want your. I don't need your. All I've got is a photograph. But it's not enough. I'd be your lover if you were there. Put your hurt on me if you dare. Such a woman, you got style. You make every man feel like a child, oh. You got some kinda hold on me. You're all wrapped up in a mystery. So wild and free, so far from me. You're all I want, my fantasy. Oh, look what you've done to this rock and roll clown. Oh-oh, look what you've done. I gotta have you. I don't want your. I don't need your. All I've got is a photograph. You've gone straight to my head. Oh, look what you've done to this rock and roll clown. Oh-oh, look what you've done. I gotta have you. I don't want your. I don't need your. All I've got is a photograph. I wanna touch you, oh. Yeah, photograph. I need more, baby. I wanna know. I wanna know. I wanna really know. I wanna touch.
