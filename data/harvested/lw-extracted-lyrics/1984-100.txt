Heavenly Father watching us fall. We take from each other and give nothing at all. Well it's a dog-gone shame. But never too late for change. So if your luck runs low. Just reach out and call His name, His name. Yah mo be there (up and over). Yah mo be there (up and over). Yah mo be there (up and over). Yah mo be there (up and over). Whenever you call. Never be lonely lost in the night. Just run from the darkness. Looking for the light. 'Cause it's a long hard road. That leads to a brighter day, hey. Don't let your heart grow cold. Just reach out and call His name, His name. Yah mo be there (up and over). Yah mo be there (up and over). Yah mo be there (up and over). Yah mo be there (up and over). Whenever you call. (Yah mo be there). You can count on it, brother. 'Cause we're all just finding our way. Traveling through time. People got to keep pushing on. No matter how many dreams slip away. Yah will be there. Well it's a dog-gone shame. But never too late for change. So when your luck runs low. Just reach out and call His name. Just call His name.
