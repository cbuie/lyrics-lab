. Who's watching. Tell me who's watching. Who's watching me. I'm just an average man with an average life. I work from 9 to 5, hey hell, I pay the price. All I want is to be left alone, in my average home. But why do I always feel. Like I'm in the Twilight Zone? and.. I always feel like somebody's watching me. And I have no privacy, whoa-oa-oa. I always feel like somebody's watching me. Tell me, is it just a dream. When I come home at night. I bang the door real tight. People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid. Or can the people on TV see me, or am I just paranoid? When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair. Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there! People say I'm crazy, just a little touched. But maybe showers remind me of "Psycho" too much. That's why.. I always feel like somebody's watching me. And I have no privacy, whoa-oa-oa. I always feel like somebody's watching me. Who's playing tricks on me?. Michael Jackson:. Synth:. Synth:. Michael Jackson. Rockwell:. Rockwell:. Rockwell:. Rockwell:. Synth:. Rockwell:. Rockwell:.
