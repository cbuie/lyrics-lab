(Paul). Say, say, say what you want. But don't play games with my affection. Take, take, take what you need. But don't leave me with no direction. (Michael). All alone. I sit home by the phone. Waiting for you, baby. Through the years. How can you stand to hear. My pleading for you, dear? You know I'm cryin'. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Yeah, yeah. (Paul). Now go, go, go where you want. But don't leave me here forever. You, you, you stay away. So long, girl, I see you never. (Michael). What can I do. Girl, to get through to you. 'Cause I love you, baby. Standing here baptized in all my tears. Baby, through the years. You know I'm cryin'. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Hee-hee-hee. Say, say, say. Got to say, say, say. (Paul). You never ever worry. And you never shed a tear. (Michael). You're sayin' that my love ain't real. Just look at my face. These tears ain't dryin'. (Paul). You, you, you can never say. That I'm not the one who really loves you. I pray, pray, pray every day. That you'll see things, girl, like I do. (Michael). What can I do. Girl, to get through to you? 'Cause I love you. baby. Standing here baptized in all my tears. Baby, through the years. You know I'm cryin'. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Hee-hee-hee (hee-hee-hee).
