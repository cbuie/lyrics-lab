You've been around for such a long time now. Oh, maybe I could leave you but I don't know how. And why should I be lonely every night. When I can be with you, oh yes, you make it right. And I don't listen to the guys who say. That you're bad for me and I should turn you away. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of love. I get a feeling when I look at you. Wherever you go now, I wanna be there too. They say we're crazy but I just don't care. And if they keep on talking, still they get nowhere. So I don't mind if they don't understand. When I look at you and you hold my hand. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of love. (Do do-do-do). Why should it matter to us if they don't approve. (Do do-do-do). We should just take our chances while we've got nothin' to lose. Baby. There's no need for living in the past. Now I've found good love and gonna make it last. I tell the others, don't bother me. 'Cause when they look at you they don't see what I see. No I don't listen to their wasted lines. Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of love. No I don't listen to their wasted lines. Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of love.
