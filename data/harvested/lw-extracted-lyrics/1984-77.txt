I'm all confused and I don't know what to do. ‘Cause I still can't get over lovin' you. I've had a time when I can't you off my mind. No, I still can't get over lovin' you. Every time I run into your friends. I just have to ask them with who and where you've been. And when they tell me what I really didn't want to know. It only breaks my heart, it makes me want you more. When I hear your name, I get going insane. ‘Cause I still can't get over lovin' you. I can't turn you loose, though I know it's self-abuse. I still can't get over lovin' you. Now I've tried to get involved with someone new. But it's just no use, ‘cause I expect them to be like you, baby. I don't know what I'm gonna do. ‘Cause every girl I date resembles you. Oh, help me, baby, I'm goin' crazy. I still can't get over lovin' you. No, oh, it's tearin' my heart apart. ‘Cause I still can't get over lovin' you. Girl, I'm so sad and it hurts me so bad. Knowin' you're with someone else (Someone else), oh. Though I have no right to be, I'm filled with jealousy. ‘Cause I want you for myself. And I'm not blamin' you, naw, baby. It's not your fault if you feel the way I do. And even though I wish that you'd still love me. It still won't change the way I feel for you. Girl, I can't forget ‘cause it's not over yet. I still can't get over lovin' you. Every breath you take, I'll be watchin' you, girl. ‘Cause I still can't get over lovin' you, mmm. (Lovin' you) There's no way that this thing is through, no. (I still can't get over) Not yet, I ain't through lovin' you. I'm gettin' mad (Lovin' you), girl, don't you ever try to leave, no, no. (I still can't get over) It'll be the last thing you'll ever do, oh. (Lovin' you). (I still can't get over lovin' you). (Lovin' you).
