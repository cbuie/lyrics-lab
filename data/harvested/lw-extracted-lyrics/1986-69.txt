Whoa, here it comes. That funny feeling again. Winding me up inside. Every time we touch. Hey, I don't know. Oh, tell me where to begin. 'Cause I never ever. Felt so much, hey. And I can't recall. Any love at all. Ah baby, this blows 'em all away. It's got what it takes. So tell me why can't this be love? Straight from my heart. Oh, tell me why can't this be love? I tell myself. Hey, only fools rush in. And only time will tell. If we stand the test of time. All I know. You've got to run to win. And I'll be damned if I'll get. Hung up on the line, hey. No, I can't recall. Anything at all. Oh, baby this blows 'em all away. Wooh. It's got what it takes. So tell me why can't this be love? You want it straight from the heart. Oh, tell me why can't this be love? Wooh. It's got what it takes. So tell me why can't this be love? Straight from my heart. Oh, tell me why can't this be love? Baby, why can't this be love? Got to know why can't this be love? I wanna know why can't this be love?.
