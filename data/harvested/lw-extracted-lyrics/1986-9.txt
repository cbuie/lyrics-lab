Kýrie, eléison. Kýrie, eléison. Kýrie. The wind blows hard against this mountainside. Across the sea into my soul. It reaches into where I cannot hide. Setting my feet upon the road. My heart is old, it holds my memories. My body burns a gem-like flame. Somewhere between the soul and soft machine. Is where I find myself again. Kýrie, eléison. Down the road that I must travel. Kýrie, eléison. Through the darkness of the night. Kýrie, eléison. Where I'm going, will you follow? Kýrie, eléison. On a highway in the light. When I was young, I thought of growing old. Of what my life would mean to me. Would I have followed down my chosen road. Or only wished what I could be. Kýrie, eléison. Down the road that I must travel. Kýrie, eléison. Through the darkness of the night. Kýrie, eléison. Where I'm going, will you follow? Kýrie, eléison. On a highway in the light. Whoa, oh, oh. Whoa, oh, oh. Whoa, oh, oh. Whoa, oh, oh. Kýrie, eléison. Down the road that I must travel. Kýrie, eléison. Through the darkness of the night. Kýrie, eléison. Where I'm going, will you follow? Kýrie, eléison. On a highway in the light. Kýrie, eléison.
