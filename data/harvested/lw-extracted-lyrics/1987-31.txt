Hit the beat now. Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven. But I'm gonna stick to my guns. Like waiting for that love that I might be getting. Mv dreams haven't yet begun, oh baby. Am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel? And my love for you, oh my, I can't conceal. Oh, I'm lost in emotion. Telling you things you really shouldn't know. Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion. Am I a fool? At least my friends think so. Baby, whatever will be. Que sera, que sera. Between you and me. Just how true are the rumors I am hearing. About the crash you have on me?. Oh baby, I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it. But I wanna believe what they see. I find myself telling you things. I don't even tell my best friend. I keep showing emotions not knowing. Just where it all stands for us. From time to time I wonder what I am in your heart. And even though I don't live there yet. I'm afraid it will be cold and dark. I'm lost in emotion. Telling you things you really shouldn't know. Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion. Am I a fool? At least my friends think so. Que sera, que sera. Baby, whatever will be. Que sera, que sera. Oh no. Baby, am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?. And my love for you, oh my, I can't conceal. Hit the beat now. With my feeling. I hit the ceiling. With big emotions. I can't be dealing. I wanna be with you. But I don't know how. In my heart, babe. I can feel the beat now. My baby. You know that I'm. , my baby. my-m-m-y-my baby.
