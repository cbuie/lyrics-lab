Like a warrior that fights. And wins the battle. I know the taste of victory. Though I went through some nights. Consumed by the shadows. And was crippled emotionally. Somehow I made it through the heartache, yes I did. I escaped. I found my way out of the darkness. I kept my faith. , kept my faith. When the river was deep I didn't falter. When the mountain was high I still believed. When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no. I knew you were waiting. Knew you were waiting for me, uh huh. With and endless desire. I kept on searching. Sure in time our eyes would meet. And like the bridge is on fire. The hurt is over. One touch and you set me free. No, I don't regret a single moment, no I don't. Looking back. When I think of all those disappointments. I just laugh. , I just laugh. When the river was deep I didn't falter. When the mountain was high I still believed. When the valley was low it didn't stop me. I knew you were waiting. Knew you were waiting for me. So we were drawn together through destiny. Ooh, boy. I know this love we share was meant to be. Knew you were waiting. Knew you were waiting. Knew you were waiting for me. I didn't falter. I still believed. It didn't stop me. I knew you were waiting. Knew you were waiting for me. I didn't falter. I still believed. It didn't stop me. I knew you were waiting. Knew you were waiting for me. I didn't falter. I still believed. It didn't stop me. Knew you were waiting. Someday. , somehow. For me. I didn't falter. I still believed. He didn't stop me. No way.
