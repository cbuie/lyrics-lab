I'm in Heaven. (Listen). Pay attention. Are you listening. You're my favorite girl. Excuse me for the moment. I'm in another world. On a mountain by a fountain. Flowers blooming everywhere. With Venus and with Cupid. The picture's very clear. Hang the sign up on the door. I say don't disturb this groove. (All I need is just me and you). Just a way to tell you. That I'm so into you. (Just so that I'm understood). And the feeling's so real. Don't disturb this groove. Erotic whispers. For the listener. The passion starts again. And the lollipops and everything. With the little taste of sin. Causing fire and desire. In this mortal soul to live. 'Til the angels fall from Heaven. And the day the earth stood still. Hang the sign up on the door. It says don't disturb this groove. (All I need is just me and you). Just a way to say. That I'm so into you. (Just so that I'm understood). And the feeling's so real. Don't disturb this groove. (All I need is just me and you). 'Cause I want to tell you. That I'm so into you. (Just so that I'm understood). And the feeling's so real. Don't disturb this groove. Close your eyes. And let the music. Put you in a mood. Can you feel it. Uh huh. (Uh huh). Baby just lock the door. And turn the phone off. It's time, it's time. For me and you. Are you ready. Hang the sign up on the door. I say don't disturb this groove. (All I need is just me and you). Just a way to tell you. That I'm so into you. (Just so that I'm understood). And the feeling's so real. Don't disturb this groove. (All I need is just me and you). 'Cause I want to tell you. That I'm so into you. (Just so that I'm understood). And the feeling's so real. Don't disturb this groove. (All I need is just me and you). 'Cause we're grooving baby. Grooving baby. And I love it baby. (Just me and you). (And it's understood). And I love it baby love it baby.
