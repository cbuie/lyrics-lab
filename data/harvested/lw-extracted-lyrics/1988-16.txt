Some dreams are in the night time. And some seem like yesterday. But leaves turn brown and fade. Ships sail away. You long to say a thousand words but. Seasons change. It feels like it's forever. No reason for emptiness. But time just runs away. No more day by day. You dream again, it seems in vain when. Seasons change. I want to feel you by my side. Don't you know I need you, baby?. It's been so long since I found you. Yet it seems like yesterday. I'll sacrifice tomorrow. Just to have you here today. Forever seems so far away. There's time for love and for play. You dream about today. Feeling slips away. The winds that blow, they go away and. Seasons change. Don't hide your feelings from inside. I've got to have your love now, baby. It's been so long since I found you. Yet it seems like yesterday. I want to feel you by my side. I've got to have your love now, baby. It's been so long since I found you. Yet it seems like yesterday. I'll sacrifice tomorrow. Just to have you here today. Just to have you here today. It's been so long since I found you. Yet it seems like yesterday. Seasons change. People change. Seasons change. Feelings change. Change the season.
