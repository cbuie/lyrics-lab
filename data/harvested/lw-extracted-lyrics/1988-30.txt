. When you make love. Do you look in your mirror? Who do you think of? Does he look like me? Do you tell lies. And say that it's forever? Do you think twice. Or just touch and see? Ooh babe. Ooh yeah. When you're alone. Do you let go? Are you wild and willin'. Or is it just for show? ooh, come on. I don't wanna touch you too much baby. 'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy. I know you think that love is the way you make it. So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it, no. It's bringin' me to my knees. It's no surprise. It's what I need. When I'm with you. Are you somewhere else? Am I gettin' through? How do you please yourself? When you wake up. Will you walk out? It can't be love. If you throw it about, ooh babe. I don't wanna touch you too much baby. 'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy. Oh. It's bringin' me to my knees. It's no surprise. It's what I need. Oh yeah, I don't wanna touch you too much baby. 'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy. I know you think that love is the way you make it. So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it. No!. It's bringin' me to my knees. It's bringin' me to my knees. It's no surprise. It's what I need.
