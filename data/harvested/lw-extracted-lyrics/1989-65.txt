I'm thinking. Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action. But like. said, "I can't get no satisfaction". The girls are all around, but none of them want to get with me. My threds are fresh and I'm looking def. Yo, what's up with L-O-C? The girls I sawjokin' at the other end of the bar. Havin' drinks with some no-name chump. When they know that I'm the star. So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina. I asked the guy, "Why you so fly?". He said, "Funky Cold Medina". Funky Cold Medina. This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks. Put a little Medina in your glass. And the girls will come real quick. It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac. A couple of sips of this love potion and she'll be on your lap. So I gave some to my dog, when he began to beg. Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me. And did the Wild Thing on my leg. He used to scratch and bite me. Before he was much, much meaner. But now all the poodles run to my house. For the Funky cold Medina. You know what I'm sayin'? I got every dog in my neighborhood. Breakin' down my door, I got Spuds McKenzie, Alex from Stroh's. They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal. I went up to this girl, she said, "Hi, my name is Sheena". I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky cold Medina. She said, "I'd like a drink, " I said OK, I'd go get it. Then a couple of sips, she sold licked her lips. And I knew that she was with it. So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned. But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess. Sheena was a man. So I threw him out, I don't fool around. With in Oscar Meyer weiner. You must be sure that your girl is pure. For the Funky Cold Medina. You know, ain't no playin' with a man. This is the 80's and I'm down with the ladies, ya know? Break it down. Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection. I took a shot as a conteatant on the Love Connection. The audience voted and you lnow they picked a winner. I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner. She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'. Instead she started talkin' about plans for a weddin'. Said wait, slow down, love, not so fast, says "I'll be seein' ya". That's why I found you don't play around. With the Funky Cold Medina. Ya know what I'm sayin', that Medina's a monster, y'all. Funky Cold Medina.
