No is not an answer. One that I might try to understand, you see. Love is only letters. Until you prove your love is here inside for me. Can you feel it (feel it) or can't you see? (can't you see?). I'll never love someone as much I know. When you see me (see me), it's what you'll get (what you'll get). Until I know it's real, it won't change how I feel. CHORUS:. What you don't know might hurt you. What you don't know. If you don't know, it won't hurt you. What you don't know. You, you play with fire. I know one day, you're gonna be the one to burn. Love is like a game. What goes around, comes around, you wait your turn. It's a feeling (feeling) to change with time (change with time). We'll always be together, wait and see. If you know me (know me), that's what you'll get (what you'll get). Until I know it's real, it won't change how I feel. CHORUS (2x). INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE. What you don't know no never know. What you don't know no never know. What you don't know no never know. What you don't know no never know. CHORUS (2x). (What you don't know). So, baby, what you don't know won't hurt you now. I don't wanna hurt you, baby, no. I don't wanna hurt you, baby, no. I don't wanna hurt you, baby, no no no. And if you don't know, you won't let go. What you don't know. Na na na na, whoa whoa, na na na. Na na na na. Na na na na, whoa whoa, na na na. Na na na na. (repeat and fade out).
