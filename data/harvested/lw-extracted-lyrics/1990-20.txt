Look at this face. I know the years are showing. Look at this life. I still don't know where it's going. I don't know much. But I know I love you. And that may be all I need to know. Look at these eyes. They never see what matters. Look at these dreams. So beaten and so battered. I don't know much. But I know I love you. That may be all I need to know. So many questions. Still left unanswered. So much I've never broken through. And when I feel you near me. Sometimes I see so clearly. The only truth I'll ever know. Is me and you. Look at this man. So blessed with inspiration. Look at this soul. Still searching for salvation. I don't know much. But I know I love you. And that may be all I need to know. I don't know much. But I know I love you. That may be all I need to know. I don't know much. But I know I love you. That may be all there is. To know. Woah-woah-ah.
