Baby baby. I'm taken with a notion. To love you with the sweetest of devotion. Baby baby. My tender love will flow from. The blue sky to the deepest ocean. Stop for a minute. Baby, I'm so glad you're mine. Yeah, you're mine. Baby baby. The stars are shining for you. And just like me, I'm sure that they adore you. Baby baby. Go walkin' through the forest. The birds above are singin' you a chorus. Stop for a minute. Baby, they're so glad you're mine. Oh yeah. And ever since the day. You put my heart in motion. Baby, I realized that there's. Just no gettin' over you. Baby baby. In any kind of weather. I'm here for you always and forever. Baby baby. No muscle man could sever. My love for you is true and it will never. Stop for a minute. Baby, I'm so glad you're mine. And ever since the day. You put my heart in motion. Baby, I realized. That there's no gettin' over you. And ever since the day. You put my heart in motion. Baby, I realized that there's. Just no gettin' over you, over you. Baby baby. Always and forever. I'm here for you baby. So glad you're mine. When I think about your eyes. It makes me smile. Baby baby, be mine. Don't stop givin' love. Don't stop, no. Glad that you're mine. Baby, I'm glad.
