Oh!. You burden me with your questions. You'd have me tell no lies. You're always asking what it's all about. But don't listen to my replies. You say to me I don't talk enough. But when I do I'm a fool. These times I've spent, I've realized. I'm going to shoot through and leave you. The things you say. Your purple prose just gives you away. The things you say. You're unbelievable. Oh!. You burden me with your problems. By telling me more than mine. I'm always so concerned. With the way you say you've always go to stop. To think of us being one. Is more than I ever know. But this time, I realize. I'm going to shoot through and leave you. The things you say. Your purple prose just gives you away. The things you say. You're unbelievable. Oh!. Seemingly lastless, don't mean you can ask us. Pushing down the relative. Bringing out your higher self. Think of the fine times. Pushing down the better few. Instead of bringing out the clues. To want the world and everything your asked to. Brace yourself with the grace of ease. I know this world ain't what it seems. You burden me with your questions. You'd have me tell no lies. You're always asking what it's all about. But don't listen to my replies. You say to me I don't talk enough. But when I do I'm a fool. These times I've spent, I've realized. I'm going to shoot through and leave you. The things you say. Your purple prose just gives you away. The things you say. It's why I love you more. The things you say. Your purple prose just gives you away. The things you say. You're unbelievable. Oh!. You're so unbelievable. You're unbelievable. Oh!. You're unbelievable.
