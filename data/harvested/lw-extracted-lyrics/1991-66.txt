This is it. It's time for you to go to the wire. You will hit. 'Cause you got the burnin' desire. It's your time. You got the horn so why don't you blow it? You are fine. You're filthy cute and baby you know it, ooh. Cream, get on top. Cream, you will cop. Cream, don't you stop. Cream, sh-boogie bop. You're so good. Baby, there ain't nobody better. So you should. Never ever go by the letter. You're so cool. Everything you do is success. Ooh, make the rules. Then break them all 'cause you are the best. Yes you are. Cream, get on top. Cream, you will cop. Cream, don't you stop. Cream, sh-boogie bop. Look up in the air, it's your guitar. Do your dance. Why should you wait any longer? Take your chance. It could only make you stronger. It's your time. You got the horn so why don't you blow it?. You're so fine. You're filthy cute and baby you know it. Cream, get on top. Cream, you will cop. Cream, don't you ever stop. Cream, sh-boogie bop. Cream. Cream. Cream, sh-boogie bop. Cream. Cream, right there. Cream. Sh-boogie bop. Cream, sh-boogie bop.
