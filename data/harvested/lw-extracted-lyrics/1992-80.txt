Here I am, I'm in the wrong bed again. It's a game I just can't win. There you are breathin' soft on my skin. Still you won't let me in. So come on. Why save your kisses for a rainy day? Baby, let the moment take your heart away. (Have you ever needed someone so bad?). Yeah. (Have you ever wanted someone). You just couldn't have. (Did you ever try so hard). That your world just fell apart? (Have you ever needed someone so bad?). And you're the girl I gotta have. I gotta have you baby. Yeah. Come on. There you go, midnight promises again. But they're broken by the dawn. You wanna go further, faster every day. But in the morning you'll be gone. And I'm alone. Why save your kisses for a rainy day? Baby, let the moment take your heart away. (Have you ever needed someone so bad?). Yeah. (Have you ever wanted someone). You just couldn't have. (Did you ever try so hard). That your world just fell apart? (Have you ever needed someone so bad?). Every dream I dream is like. Some kinda rash 'n' reckless scene. To give out such crazy love. You must be some kinda drug. And if my time don't ever come. For me you're still the same. Damned if I don't, damned if I do. I gotta get a fix on you. (Have you ever needed someone so bad?). Yeah. (Have you ever wanted someone). You just couldn't have. (Did you ever try so hard). That your world just fell apart? (Have you ever needed someone so bad?). So bad. (Have you ever wanted someone). Have you ever wanted someone, yeah. (Did you ever try so hard). That your world just fell apart? (Have you ever needed someone so bad?). And you're the girl I gotta have. I gotta have you baby. Yeah, yeah. It's a game I just can't win, oh. (Have you ever needed someone so bad?). Yeah. (Have you ever wanted someone). Have you ever wanted someone. You just couldn't have? (Did you ever try so hard). Yeah.
