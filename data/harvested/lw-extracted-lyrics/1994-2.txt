I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies. And I swear like the shadow that's by your side. I see the questions in your eyes. I know what's weighing on your mind. You can be sure I know my part. 'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years. You'll only cry those happy tears. And though I made mistakes. I'll never break your heart. And I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies. I'll be there. I swear like a shadow that's by your side. I'll be there. For better or worse. Till death do us part. I'll love you with every beat of my heart. And I swear, ooh. I'll give you every thing I can. I'll build your dreams with these two hands. We'll hang some memories on the walls. And when. there's silver in your hair. You won't have to ask if I still care. 'Cause as the time turns the page. My love won't age at all. And I swear. by the moon and the stars in the skies. I'll be there. I swear. like the shadow that's by your side. I'll be there. For better or worse. Till death do us part. I'll love you with every beat of my heart. And I swear. And I swear. by the moon and the stars in the skies. I'll be there. I swear like the shadow that's by your side. I'll be there. For better or worse. Till death do us part. I'll love you with every. beat of my heart. I swear, I swear. Oh, I swear.
