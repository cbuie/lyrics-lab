In the thundering rain. You stare into my eyes. I can feel your hand moving up my thighs. Skirt around my waist. Wall against my face. I can feel your lips. I don't wanna stop just because. People walkin' by are watchin' us. I don't give a damn what they think. I want you now. I don't wanna stop just because. You feel so good inside of my love. I'm not gonna stop no no no. I want you all I wanna say is. Any time, and any place I don't care who's around. Any time, and any place I don't care who's around. No no no. Dancing on the floor. Feelin' the slow groove. My mind is starting to burn. With forbidden thoughts. Strangers all around. With the lights down low. I was thinking maybe we could. well you know. I don't wanna stop just because. People walkin' by are watchin' us. I don't give a damn what they think. I want you now. I don't wanna stop just because. You feel so good inside of my love. I'm not gonna stop no no no. I want you all I wanna say is. Any time, and any place I don't care who's around. No no no. Any time baby, and any place I don't care who's around. (Say it again). Any time (any time), and any place I don't care who's around. I don't care who's around. (ad lib).
