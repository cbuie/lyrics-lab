Take me now, baby, here as I am. Hold me close, and try and understand. Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe. Love is a banquet on which we feed. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now. Can't hurt you now. Can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone. Love is a ring, a telephone. Love is an angel, disguised as lust. Here in our beds until the morning comes. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now. Can't hurt you now. Can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. With love we sleep, With doubt the vicious circle turns, and burns. Without you, oh I cannot live, Forgive the yearning burning. I believe it's time to heal to feel, So take me now. Take me now. Take me now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us.
