There was a time in my life. When I opened my eyes and there you were,. You were more than a dream,. I could reach out and touch you,. Girl that was long ago. There are somethings that I guess I'll never know,. When you love someone You got to learn to let them go. When I dream about you,. That's when everything's all right,. You're in my arms. Here next to me, forever. When I dream about you,. Girl you never go away,. Just close my eyes. Wait for my dreams,. Cause I still love, loving you. How can I get you to see. That I'm falling apart. Since you've been gone,. I can never be sure. I could ever let go. Your love is much to strong,. There are somethings that I guess. I'll never know,. When you love someone. You got to learn to let them go. When I dream about you,. That's when everything's all right,. You're in my arms. Here next to me, forever. When I dream about you,. Girl you never go away,. Just close my eyes. Wait for my dreams,. Cause I still love, loving you. There are somethings that I guess. I'll never know,. When you love someone. You got to learn to let them go. When I dream about you,. That's when everythings all right,. You're in my arms. Here next to me, forever. When I dream about you,. Girl you never go away,. Just close my eyes. Wait for my dreams,. Cause I still love, loving you.
