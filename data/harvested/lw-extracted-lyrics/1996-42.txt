Hey, yeah ya know what? I like the players. No diggity, no doubt, uh. Play on, playa. Play on, play that. Yo Dre, drop the verse. It's going down fade to Blackstreet. The homies got RB collab' creations bump like acne. No doubt, I put it down, never slouch. As long as my credit could vouch. A dog couldn't catch me, ass out. Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves. Attractin' honeys like a magnet. Givin' them ear-gasms with my mellow accent. Still movin' his flavor. With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy. The original rump shakers. Shorty get down, good Lord. Baby got 'em open all over town. Strictly biz she don't play around. Cover much grounds, got game by the pound. Gettin' paid is her forte. Each and every day, true player way. I can't get her outta my mind. I think about the girl all the time. East side to the west side. Push your fat rides, it's no surprise. She got tricks in the stash. Stacking up the cash, fast when it comes to the gas. By no means average. She's on when she's got to have it. Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in. Can I get down so I can win? I like the way you work it. I got to bag it up. I like the way you work it. I got to bag it up. I like the way you work it. I got to bag it up. I like the way you work it. I got to bag it up. She's got class and style. Street knowledge by the pound. Baby never act wild. Very low key on the profile. Catchin' feelings is a no. Let me tell you how it goes. Curve's the word, spin's the verb. Lovers it curves so freak what you heard, (oooohh). Rollin' with the phatness. You don't even know what the half is. You got to pay to play. Just for shorty bang bang to look your way. I like the way you work it. Trump tight all day, everyday. You're blowing my mind, maybe in time. Baby, I can get you in my ride. I like the way you work it. I got to bag it up. I like the way you work it. I got to bag it up. I like the way you work it. I got to bag it up. I like the way you work it. I got to bag it up. Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo. Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo. Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo. Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo. 'Cause that's my peeps and we row G. Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet. What chu know about me, not a motha fuckin' thing. Cartier wooded frames supported by my shorty. As for me, icy gleamin' pinky diamond ring. We be's the baddest clique up on this scene. Ain't you gettin' bored with these fake ass broads. I shows and proves, no doubt I be diggin' you so. Please excuse if I come across rude. That's just me and that's how a playette's got to be. Stay kickin' game with a capital G. Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be. Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing. So Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncey. I'll be sending a car, let's say around three thirty. Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity. I like the way you work it. I got to bag it up.
