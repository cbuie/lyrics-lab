A Hundred Million dollar treasure, I'd give the world to make you mine. I'd put a string of pearls right in your hand. Make love on a beach of jet black sand. Outside in the rain, we can do it all night. I'll touch all the places he would not. And some you never knew would get you hot. Nothing is forbidden, when we touch. CHORUS -. Baby, I wanna do. All of, the things your man wont do (i'll do them for you). Baby, I wanna do. All of, the things your man wont do (i'll do them for you). I'll take you out on a night cruise, on a Yacht.just cant loose. Coz we got alot to look forward to.1,2 whatcha gonna doÂ ? What good is a Diamond, nobody can see? I hear he's got you on lockdown, but I got the master key. I'll light up all the candles all around. Show me to the subway I'll go down. Nothing can be sweeter, than the sound of making love.
