When I was young. I never needed anyone. And making love was just for fun. Those days are gone. Livin' alone. I think of all the friends I've known. When I dial the telephone. Nobody's home. All by myself. Don't wanna be all by myself anymore. Hard to be sure. Sometimes I feel so insecure. And love's so distant and obscure. Remains the cure. All by myself. Don't wanna be all by myself anymore. All by myself. Don't wanna live all by myself anymore. When I was young. I never needed anyone. Making love was just for fun. Those days are gone. All by myself. Don't wanna be all by myself anymore. All by myself. Don't wanna live. Oh, ohoho. Don't wanna live by myself, by myself anymore! By myself anymore. Ohohoho! All by myself. Don't wanna live. I never, never, never needed anyone.
