It's body bumpin' time baby. (Love makin' hopefully while we grind). Uuh, don't you want me? 'cause I want you. Let's do this. Why don't we do it? chorus. For my graduation, let you know what's on my mind. It's about that time, that I hit you for some bump and grind. I'm in the mood for you, I wanna feel your groove girl you. Can creep on with me, let's go get up on a room. Makin' me do things that I never did before. Behind closed doors, I'm gonna make you shout for more. This freaky thing is on, body bumpin' all night long. No doubt about it if you want it I can bring it on, bump me. chorus. Bump'in, you and me. Everybody get your freak on. Bump'in, you and me. Everybody get your freak on. chorus.
