(Peter Gunz). New York to the heart, but got love for all. Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball. Uptown is the place where I lay my dome. On the streets of the Bronx where my fa-mi-ly roam. Hoe damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter. Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater. I never really liked to play a fool like that. But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat.. splat, like Deja Vu. And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew. I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al. Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt. Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged. Anything less than that, you keep the change. Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke. Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope. Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife. Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife. And that's life, you should learn how to treat her. I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her. and beat her, niggaz in the Bronx call me Lex. cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex. and I lounge on Lex', and I love sex. And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex. Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul. But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't time to fold, ho. Chorus: Peter Gunz, Lord Tariq (two parts). (Peter Gunz). New York niggaz got crazy game. But outta town niggaz is all the same. Brooklyn niggaz get crazy loot. That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot. Harlem niggaz know how to play. Mack the 600, gettin crazy pay. Niggaz outta Queens got shit on lock. Strapped with the glock, runnin up in yo' spot. (Lord Tariq). But if it wasn't for the Bronx. this rap shit probably never would be going on. so tell me where you from? PG:.
