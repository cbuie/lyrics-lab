There are times when I look above and beyond. There are times when I feel your love around me, baby. I'll never forget my baby. I'll never forget you. There are times when I look above and beyond. There are times when I feel your love around me, baby. I'll never forget my baby. When I feel that I don't belong. Draw my strength from the words when you said. Hey it's about you baby. Look deeper inside you baby. I dream about us together again. When I want us together again, baby. I know we'll be together again 'cause. Everywhere I go. Every smile I see. I know you are there. Smilin' back at me. Dancin' in moonlight. I know you are free. 'Cause I can see your star. Shinin' down on me. Good times we'll share again. Makes me wanna dance. Say it loud and proud. All my love's for you. Always been a true angel to me, now above. I can't wait for you to wrap your wings around me baby. Wrap them around me baby. (Ever see my baby). (Happy for my baby). (Together again, ooh). (Together again, ooh). (Together again, ooh). (Together again, ooh). (Be together, baby). (Together again, my baby).
