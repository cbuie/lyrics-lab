We both know that I shouldn't be here. This is wrong. And baby it's killing me. It's killing you. But both of us trying to be strong. I've got somewhere else to be. Promises to keep. Someone else who loves me. And trusted me fast asleep. I've made up my mind. There is no turning back. She's been good to me. And she deserves better than that. It's the hardest thing. I'll ever have to do. To look you in the eye. And tell you i don't love you. It's the hardest thing. I'll ever have to lie. To show no emotion. When you start to cry. I can't let you see. What you mean to me. When my hands are tied. And my hearts not free. We're not meant to be. It's the hardest thing. I'll ever have to do. To turn around and walk away. Pretending i don't love you. I know we'll meet again. Fate has a place and time. So you can get on with your life. I've got to be cruel to be kind. Like Doctor Zhivago. All my love i'll be sending. And you'll never know. 'Cause there can be no happy ending. It's the hardest thing. I'll ever have to do. To look you in the eye. And tell you i don't love you. It's the hardest thing. I'll ever have to lie. To show no emotion. When you start to cry. I can't let you see. What you mean to me. When my hands are tied. And my hearts not free. We're not meant to be. It's the hardest thing. I'll ever have to do. To turn around and walk away. Pretending i don't love you. Maybe another time, another day. As much as I want to I can't stay. I've made up my mind. There's no turning back. She's been good to be. And she deserves better than that. It's the hardest thing. I'll ever have to do. To look you in the eye. And tell you i don't love you. It's the hardest thing. I'll ever have to lie. To show no emotion. When you start to cry. I can't let you see. What you mean to me. When my hands are tied. And my hearts not free. We're not meant to be. It's the hardest thing. I'll ever have to do. To turn around and walk away. Pretending i don't love you.
