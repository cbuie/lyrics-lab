That's right. Life is funny ain't it. Sometimes you can end up with. Somebody you really don't wanna be with. And others left to figure it out. Check it. She was more than a women, a goddess for all to see. All I ever needed was her right here loving me. For a while we were cool and the groovin' of love was on. But I still remember how it felt when her love was gone. (Bridge). Tattered picture book. Was a photograph she took years ago. Secret memories in her mind, how could love be so unkind. Heartbreak time. (Chorus). Faded pictures in a broken glass. Like a mirror revealing. What the woman is feeling. Was it someone from a distant past. 'Cos it's breaking my heart. To watch her stare into the glass. As she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face. I could see her reminiscing, why her life had to be this way. As she stopped and she came to a page where her diary end. To smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover I suppose. (Bridge). (Chorus). As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting. 'Cos she's lost inside the past (x2). (Chorus). Faded pictures in a broken glass.
