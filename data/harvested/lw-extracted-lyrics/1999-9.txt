How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here. I've tried that love thing for the last time. My heart says no, no. Nobody's supposed to be here. But you came along and changed my mind. I've spent all my life. On a search to find. The love who'll stay for eternity. That heaven sent to fulfill my needs. But when I turn around. Again love has knocked me down. My heart got broken. Oh it hurt so bad. I'm sad to say love wins again. So I place my heart under lock and key. To take some time and take care of me. But I turn around and you're standing here. How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here. I've tried that love thing for the last time. My heart says no, no. Nobody's supposed to be here. But you came along and changed my mind. This time I swear I'm through. But if only you knew. How many times I've said those words. Then fall again, when will I ever learn? Knowing these tears I've cried. This lovely black butterfly. Must take a chance and spread my wings. Love can make you do some crazy things. So I place my heart under lock and key. To take some time and take care of me. But I turn around and you're standing here (How did you). Standing here (How did you get here?). No, yeah (Nobody's supposed to be here). Oouuuhhh. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. (No, ohhhhhhhhhhhh, oh) How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here (Yeah, oh yeah). I've tried that love thing for the last time (I've tried it over and over, you know). My heart says no, no (My heart says no, no, no, no). Nobody's supposed to be here (Nobody's supposed to be here). But you came along and changed my mind (Came along and you changed). How did you get here? (I'm not supposed to love you). Nobody's supposed to be here (I'm not supposed to care anymore). I've tried that love thing for the last time. My heart says no, no (No, no, no, no, no, no). Nobody's supposed to be here (No, no, no, no, no, no). But you came along and changed my mind.
