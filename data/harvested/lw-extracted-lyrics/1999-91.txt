R-U-G-R-A-T-S. Chorus: Mýa and Blackstreet. Take me there, I wanna go there. Take me there, Let's go there. Take me to that great place with wonders and wishes. Take me there, I wanna go there. Take me there. You know where. Just take me to that great place with wonders and wishes. Verse One: Mýa. Sittin here thinkin bout yesterday. About what we did and how we used to play. Just the thought of you brings a smile upon my face. That's how it makes me feel to see you everyday. Where we go, nobody knows. And what we do, is between me and you. So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place. Where smiles come to life, and dreams come true. (Chorus). Verse Two: Chauncey Of Blackstreet. Let's make a wish. Close your eyes and count to five. Cuz you know that everything will be alright. See the magic in your eyes. Strong enough you know. To bring your dreams to life. Where we go, Nobody knows. And what we do, is between me and you. So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place. I don't want this dream to ever go away. (Chorus). Rap One: Mase. Angelica's the one with all the exposure. Dil is the one who drop in the stroller. Tommy got the whole world on his shoulders. While Dil cries to sleep, Til' his eyes get bleak. I'm identical to Chucky, Chucky to petro. Chucky get scared, Chucky says "Let's Go.". If I was a rugrat, it would've been so real. Me and my twin would've been just like Phil and Lil. Rap Two: Blinky Blink. Got one wish, Blink grant you one trip. Where we going, it's an adventure, who you wanna come with. See you my little brother that I'll come get. Run with, But it gotta be done quick. See Chucky is scared and Tommy is sad. And Phil and Lil misses their mommy and dad. So take the time and day. And we'll find the place. And I guarantee that we will all get home safe. Mýa: Just Take me there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Chorus).
