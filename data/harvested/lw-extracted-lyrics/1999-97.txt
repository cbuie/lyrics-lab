Helped me to free the me inside. Helped me hear the music of my heart. Helped me hear the music of my heart. You've opened my eyes, you've opened the door. To something I've never known before. And your love is the music of my heart. (Music of my heart). You were the one. Always on my side (always on my side). Always standing by (always standing by). Seeing me through. You were the song that always made me sing (made me sing, made me sing). I'm singin this for you (singin this for you baby). Everywhere I go I'll think of where I've been. And of the one who knew me better than anyone ever will again. You taught me to run. You taught me to fly. Helped me to free the me inside. Helped me hear the music of my heart.
