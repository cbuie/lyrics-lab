When I get you all alone. I’m gonna take off all your clothes. Ain’t nobody gonna interrupt my game, oh no, no. Ever since you’ve been hanging around. I’ve been trying to figure out. What I can say to you to get some play, yeah. Couldn’t we do what we did last night again? Baby you and I’d be better than friends. Don’t you think it’s time we went a bit further, oh yeah? Every night when we say goodbye. How can I help looking in your eyes? Wondering why you and I haven’t hit it. Can we get it on? I’m kinda faded but I feel alright. Thinking about making my move tonight. I can’t pretend that you’re only my friend. When you’re holding my body tight. ‘Cause I like the way you’re making it move. I like the way you’re making me wait. At the end of the night when I make up your mind. You’ll be coming on home with me. Yeah, you know you got it. And you know I want it. I can’t wait to take you home. (You know you got it and I.). I don’t want to be rude at all. I just want to be where you go. Think what we could do alone. (Yeah).

Just another day. Around the way. With me up close. With everything ok. ‘Cause I'm not like the rest. Indecision with best. Thrust with my full court press. Just because they hate it. How's it go. Hi, yo, I'm faded. I’m kinda faded but I feel alright. Thinking about making my move tonight. I can’t pretend that you’re only my friend.
