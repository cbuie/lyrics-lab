Don't be trippin' when you see us in the clubs, Just show a little love. Represent your side like me. Cuz around here. If you slip you catch a hot on. Your rides sharp, but a couple of us got one. Belvedere in the rear. Of the club pulled up on dubs. And we 'bout to go and buy the bar up. So So for sure we ain't playin. hang with no lames, if you bumpin say it. [Chorus]. Aye where the party the party at? Girls is on their way, where the Bacardi at? Bottles and models talkin' all of that. You know I can't forget about my thugs (Where the party at?). And all my girls (Where the party at?). Off in the clubs (Where the party at?). If the parties where you at let me here you say. [bridge]. All the girls in the club in their best outfit. Just showin that skin just tyrin to make a ***** wanna spit. Where you been girl? You and your friend. Need to come to the back, where we got it locked down at. In your white t-shirt or a 3 piece suit. Don't matter what you wear. All that matter is who your with. Some jiggy and some straight grindin. All up in the club is just to have a good time. [Chorus]. [Bridge]. (Nelly). Somebody show me where the party at dirty, somewhere where. its crackin' right around 1 30, never get there too early. Comin' as is (hey), do-rags and tims. I'm rollin' fast in this little jag and benz. With the Rose, not the one with the stem, the one with the rims. The one that seem to make more enemies then friends. I'm slidin' in pass those (hoes) both eyes closed , both arms rosed. both charms rolls, with the S O S O D E dot F. Buyin' bottles & bottles til there ain't none left. I'm quick to go left, I blaze with no ref. i jams more than def baby show me the club. I'm like, hey? where that Bacardi at? (come on ya'll), I'm a mix it with the Crys. Baby what's wrong with that? We in the V.I.P's twisted down right splifted. Two way a*****do a boo like you missed me. [Chorus]. [Bridge]x2. If the party is where you at let me here you say. Uh ohhhhhhh (oh oh oh oh) x3. Left side just put your hands up, throw 'em up. Right side just put your hands up, throw 'em up. Everybody put your hands up, throw 'em. When the beat comes back around, everyone do it again. Do the east side run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah). Do my south side run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah). And them haters ain't hittin on, ain't talking about. And they look like,. if the partys where youre at let me hear you say.
