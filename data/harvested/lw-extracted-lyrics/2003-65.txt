The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow. And so am I. Workday passes like molasses in wintertime. But it's July. Gettin' paid by the hour and older by the minute. My boss just pushed me over the limit. I'd like to call him something. I think I'll just call it a day. Pour me something tall and strong. Make it a Hurricane before I go insane. It's only half-past twelve, but I don't care. It's five o'clock somewhere. Well this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon. Half the night. Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay. Hey, but that's alright. I ain't had a day off now in over a year. My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here. If the phone's for me. You can tell them I just sailed away. And pour me something tall and strong. Make it a Hurricane before I go insane. It's only half-past twelve, but I don't care. It's five o'clock somewhere. I could pay off my tab. Pour myself in a cab. And be back to work by two. At a moment like this. I can't help but wonder:. What would Jimmy Buffett do?. "Funny you should ask, Alan. I'd say, pour me something tall and strong. Make it a Hurricane before I go insane. It's only half past twelve, but I don't care. Pour me something tall and strong. Make it a Hurricane, before I go insane. It's only half past twelve, but I don't care" (he don't care). If I don't care. It's Five O'Clock somewhere. "What time zone am I on? What Country am I in?". It don't matter it's Five O'Clock somewhere. "It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it". I heard that. "You've been there haven't you?". Yes sir. "I've seen your boat there". I've been to Margaritaville a few times. "Alright, well that's good". Stumbled my way back. "OK we just want to make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons". Between the buoys, I got it. "Alright, well it's five o'clock let's go somewhere". I'm ready, crank it up. "Lets get out of here". I'm gone.
