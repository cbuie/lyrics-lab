Becky was a beauty from south Alabama. Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer. Think he even did a little time in the slammer. What was I thinkin'? She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate. Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge. We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate. What was I thinkin'? Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay. But that crossed my mind a little too late. 'cause I was. Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right. There in the middle by me. I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get. Goin' where a night might lead. I know what I was feelin'. But what was I thinkin'. what was I thinkin'. By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels. Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel. Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field. What was I thinkin'? Out the other side she was hollerin' faster. Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin'. Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'. What was I thinkin'? Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay. But that crossed my mind a little too late. 'cause I was. Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right. There in the middle by me. I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get. Goin' where a night might lead. I know what I was feelin'. But what was I thinkin'. what was I thinkin'. When a mountain of a man with a "born to kill" tattoo. Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth. We ran outside hood-slidin' like bo duke. What was I thinkin'? I finally got her home at a half past too late. Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway. Put it in park as he started my way. What was I thinkin', oh what was I thinkin'. Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin. And like a bullet we were gone again. 'cause I was. Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right. There in the middle by me. I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get. Goin' where a night might lead. I know what I was feelin'. But what was I thinkin'. what was I thinkin'.
