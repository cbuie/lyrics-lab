I've been up to my neck, working six days a week. Wearing holes in the soles, of the shoes on my feet. Been dreamin' of getting away, since I don't know. Ain't no better time than now, for Mexico. No shoes, no shirt, no problems. Blues what blues, hey I forgot 'em. The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand, with no bottom. And no shoes, no shirt, no problems. No problems. Want a towel or a chair, in the sand by the sea. Wanna look through my shades, and see you there with me. Wanna soak up life for awhile, and lay back low. No boss no clock no stress, no dress code. No shoes, no shirt, no problems. Blues what blues, hey I forgot 'em. The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand, with no bottom. And no shoes, no shirt, no problems. Babe lets get packed, tank tops and flip-flops, if you got 'em. No shoes, no shirt, no problems. No problems.
