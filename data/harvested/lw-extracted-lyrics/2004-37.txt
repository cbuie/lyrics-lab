¡Vámonos! Save me from this prison. Lord help me get away. 'Cause only you can save me now. From this misery. I've been lost in my own place. And I'm getting weary. (How far is Heaven?). And I know that I need to change. My ways of living. (How far is Heaven?). Lord can you tell me? I've been locked up way too long. In this crazy world. (How far is Heaven?). And I just keep on praying Lord. And just keep on living. (How far is Heaven?). Yeah, Lord can you tell me? (How far is Heaven?). 'Cause I just gotta know how far, yeah. (How far is Heaven?). Yeah, Lord can you tell me? Tú que estás en alto cielo. Échame tu bendición. 'Cause I know there's a better place. Than this place I'm living. (How far is Heaven?). And I just got to have some faith. And just keep on giving. (How far is Heaven?). Yeah, Lord can you tell me? (How far is Heaven?). I just got to know how far, yeah. (How far is Heaven?). Yeah, Lord can you tell me? (How far is Heaven?). 'Cause I just gotta know how far. I just wanna know how far.
