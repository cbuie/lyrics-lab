"I'm rolling down a lonley highway. Asking god to please forgive me. For messing up the blessing. He gave to me. I see, Everythings clearer now. The nights is black. Black as its ever been. Without my girl imma lose it. I pray that he'd just shed his grace on me, I need, Just to be back with my baby. Chorus. Feel like I just walked right out of heaven. Feel like I have damn near threw my life away, hey yea yea. Like a child thats lost at seven. Dont know what to do feel like I just walk right out of heaven. See my mamma told me. Thats if its meant to be. She'll come back and she'll forgive me. And the best thing I can do is to just. Let her, let her go, I know, I don't wanna do it. But if I continue to push. She'll just pull away. And I know that in my heat its a reality. I didn't treat her like she wanted to be treated,. And I hope that shes not gone for good (no no no). Chorus X 2. Feel like I just walked right out of heaven. Feel like I have damn near threw my life away, hey yea yea. Like a child thats lost at seven. Dont know what to do feel like I just walk right out of heaven. [Bridge 1]. Hey girl. Waiting for you all the time,. Supposed to move on with my life,. And girl I tried and I tried. I feel like I can't walk. I feel like I can't talk girl. I dont know what to do. To get back right with you. I feel like I just. Walked outta heaven. [Bridge 2-Wingo]. If u ever loved somebody. And if you ever had somebody. But you know that you hurt that somebody. Let me here you say yea. Chorus Til Fade. Feel like I just walked right out of heaven. Feel like I have damn near threw my life away, hey yea yea. Like a child thats lost at seven. Dont know what to do feel like I just walk right out of heaven. ".
