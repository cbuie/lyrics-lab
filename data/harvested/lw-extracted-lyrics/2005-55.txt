(Intro ' Trick Daddy and Cee-Lo). Uh huh yeah. Yeah hah. Oh man I got a sweet tooth, can you dig it. After this one you gunna need a root canal. Hehe. I love sugar, oh man. This one for all the nice, clean, decent women. Lay it on me girl. Pay close attention. Chorus. (Cee-Lo). She put that sugar, (oooh) on my tongue (oooh). Shes gonna, (oooh) gimme gimme some (oooh). She put it right there on my tongue (sweet sweet, lover lover). Ohh she put it right there on my tongue (she turns me on, like no other). (Trick Daddy). Gimme some of your butter pecan. And put it right there, on the tip of my tongue. Hold it, right chyea, cause baby, if I bite ya I bet ya like it! Fresh finale is a helluva fate for me. Strawberries two cherries and whipped cream. The best dreams are the wet dreams. The rest is just a flick without a sex scene. Orderely I speak the truth. Cause the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. Florida oranges and Georgia peaches. When they nice and ripe they the best for eatin. All southern pores be cravin for. an old slice of pie after they main course. What they game for, I came for. I gotta thang for you that I came for. Chorus 2x. (Ludacris). Put that sugar on my tongue tongue. Yippie yippie yum yum. Goodie goodie gum drop, put me in a tongue lock. did it til my body went numb numb. laid her on her back back. turn around gave her bottom a smack smack. shes the woman from the block with the best of beat. but I wont stop til im pullin out tracks tracks. it was lust at first sight. and she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me. and my size was just right. plus she wanted a man with a little security. said I been around the world twice. and my name ring bells from Atlanta to sicily. cause she wanted it all night. put the bubbles in the tub and ludacris and me. Chorus 2x. (Trick Daddy). Sweetie you look so incredible. So delicious, and so damn edible. All I need is some honey and syrup. And a little butter to rub down all your curves. And no need for the lemonade. Well pour lime and some grape kool-aid. Im gunna call you caramel. Cause im bout to go coo-coo to test your cocoa puffs. One more I feel ya up, milk butter your colon up. Supper time and I dont hold me up. Im bout to choke this up before I slow it up. Honey you look like a hundred. Eat strawberries with a whipped cream filling. Top baller with the peach condom. But a (who who) might outta do me betta. Chorus 2x.
