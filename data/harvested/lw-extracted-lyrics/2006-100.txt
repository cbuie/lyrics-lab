Alright, yeah. I'm wandering the streets in a world underneath it all. Nothing seems to be. Nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have. Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger. Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you. What I feel about you. I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have. And cannon ball into the water. I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have. For you I will. Forgive me if I st-stutter. From all of the clutter in my head. Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes. Like a water-bed. Do I seem familiar. I crossed you in hallways a thousand times. No more camouflage. I want to be exposed. And not be afraid to fall. Chorus 2. I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have. And cannon ball into the water. I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have. For you I will. Always want what you can't have. But I got to try. I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have. For you I will, for you I will, for you I will, For You. If I could dim the lights in the mall. And create a moon, Yeah I would. And shout out your name so it echoes in every room Yeah. That's what I'd do. That's what I'd do. To get through to you Yeah. CHORUS 2. For you I will.
