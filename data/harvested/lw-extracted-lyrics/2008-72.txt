Oh. Never find a love like this. Well we go back so far, Swinging in your backyard, All the things that we used to do. We were cool back in high school. Ooh I really liked you, Must've been your attitude. And that's why you keep on runnin'. in and out of my mind. As the years they all roll by, Baby now I know why. I keep comin' back to you. You're the only one that knows me, Love it when you hold me, I'll never find a love like this. Let me hear you say. Now we'll never be lonely, Look at whatcha showed me, I'll never find a love like this. When this life tried to keep us apart, You keep callin' me back to your heart. Let me hear you say. I'm so glad you found me, Wrap your world around me, You'll never find a love like this. All the guys tried to take me, You're the one who saved me, I feel like I owe you my life. And as strange as it may seem, I'll go if you take me, I'm willing to sacrifice. That's why you keep on runnin'. in and out of my mind. As the years they all roll by, It's not hard to know why, I keep comin back to you. You're the only one that knows me, Love it when you hold me, I'll never find a love like this. Let me hear you say. Now we'll never be lonely, Look at whatcha showed me, I'll never find a love like this. When this life tried to keep us apart, You keep callin' me back to your heart. Let me hear you say. I'm so glad you found me, Wrap your world around me, You'll never find a love like this. Me never find a lo lo lo love like this, That still make me think about my middle school kiss. I sit here in this chair and I wish, For you not to leave me now. My friends they always told me. Not to make you my wifey, Man they was puttin' you down. And now they see we rollin', Me and you we strollin', They don't wanna come around. Let me hear you say, You're the only one that knows me, Love it when you hold me, I'll never find a love like this. Let me hear you say. Now we'll never be lonely, Look at whatcha showed me, I'll never find a love like this. When this life tried to keep us apart, You keep callin' me back to your heart. Let me hear you say. I'm so glad you found me, Wrap your world around me, You'll never find a love like this. Oh Never find a love like this. When this life tried to keep us apart, you keep callin me back to your heart, Let me hear you say, Oh Never find a love like this. Oh Never find a love like this.
