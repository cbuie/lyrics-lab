(. ). Feel it coming in the air. Hear the screams from everywhere. I'm addicted to the thrill. It's a dangerous love affair. Can't be scared when it goes down. Got a problem, tell me now. Only thing that's on my mind. Is who goin' run this town tonight. Who goin' run this town tonight. We goin' run this town! Wassup. Wassup. (Jay-Z). We are, yeah, I said it, we are. This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance. Get your fatigues on, all-black everything. Black cards, blacks cars, all-black everything. And that girl's a black birds riding with their poop I get more in-depth if you boys really real enough. This is La Familia, I'll explain later. But for now, let me get back to this paper. I'm a couple bands down, and I'm tryin' get back. I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks. Me, I'm talking five, comma, six zeros, got zeros, jigga. Back to running circles round niggas, now we squared up, hold up. (. - Chorus). Life's a game, but it's not fair. I break the rules, so I don't care. So I keep doin' my own thang. Walkin' tall against the rain. Victory's within the mile. Almost there, don't give up now. Only thing that's on my mind. Is who goin' run this town tonight. Hey, hey, hey. Who's goin' run this town tonight. (Jay-Z). We are, yeah, I said it, we are. You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar. Please follow the leader, so Eric B., we are. Microphone fiend, this the return of the God. Peace, God, Ah, ah, it ain't no nobody fresher. I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela. On the table screaming, "Fuck the other side, they jealous". We got a banquet full of broads, they got a table full of fellas. Yeah, and they ain't spending no cake. They should throw they hand in 'cause they ain't got no spades. Yeah, my whole team got dough. So my banquet is looking like Millionaires' Row. Yeah. (. - Chorus). Life's a game, but it's not fair. I break the rules, so I don't care. So I keep doin' my own thang. Walkin' tall against the rain. Victory's within the mile. Almost there, don't give up now. Only thing that's on my mind. Is who goin' run this town tonight. Hey, hey, hey. Who's goin' run this town tonight. (. ). It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow. To everybody on your dick, no homo. I bought my whole family whips, no Volvos. Next time I'm in Church, please no photos. Police escorts, everybody passports. This the life that everybody ask for. This the fast life, we are on a crash course. What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Rav 4. But I know that if I stay stunting. All these girls only gon want one thing. I can spend my whole life good will hunting. Only good gon come is it's good when I'm coming. She got an ass that'll swallow up a G-string. And up top, uh, two bee stings. And I'm feasting off the Riesling. And my nigga just made it out the precinct. We give a damn 'bout the drama that you do bring. I'm just tryin' change the color of your mood ring. Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things. Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings? What's that, Ye? Baby, these heels. Is that a May. what?? Baby, these wheels. You tripping when you ain't sipping, have a refill. You feelin' like you running, huh?. Now you know how we feel. Wassup (Jay-Z). (. ). Hey, hey, hey. We goin' run this town tonight. Wassup (Jay-Z).
