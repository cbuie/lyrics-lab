Beautiful girls all over the world. I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted. They got nothin' on you baby. Nothin' on you baby. They might say, "Hi," and I might say, "Hey.". But you shouldn't worry about what they say. 'Cause they got nothin' on you baby. Nothin' on you baby. Yeah. I know you feel where I'm coming from. Regardless of the things in my past that I've done. Most of it really was for the hell of the fun. On a carousel so around I spun. With no direction just tryna get some. Tryna chase skirts living in the summer sun. And so I lost more than I had ever won. And honestly I ended up with none. It's so much nonsense it's on my conscience. I'm thinking maybe I should get it out. And I don't wanna sound redundant. But I was wondering. If there was something that you wanna know. But nevermind that we should let it go. 'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode. And all the bad thoughts just let 'em go. , go. , go. Beautiful girls all over the world. I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted. They got nothin' on you baby. Nothin' on you baby. They might say hi. and I might say hey. But you shouldn't worry (ha ha) about what they say. 'Cause they got nothin' on you baby. Nothin' on you baby. Yeah. Hands down, there will never be another one. I've been around and I've never seen another one. Because your style, I ain't really got nothin' on. And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on. Baby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes. And you keep it real, while them others stay plastic. You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic. Stop, now think about it. I've been to London. , I've been to Paris. Even way out there in Tokyo (Tokyo). (yeah). (yeah). (steal the show). (got me froze). If you never knew, well, now you know. Know (know), know. Beautiful girls (yeah) all over the world. I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted. They got nothin' on you baby. Nothin' on you baby. They might say hi. and I might say hey. But you shouldn't worry (ha ha) about what they say. 'Cause they got nothin' on you baby. Nothin' on you baby. Yeah. Everywhere I go, I'm always hearing your name. And no matter where I'm at, girl you make me wanna sing. Whether a bus or a plane (plane) or a car or a train. No other girl's on my brain and you the one to blame. Beautiful girls (yeah) all over the world. I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted. They got nothin' on you baby. Nothin' on you baby. They might say hi. and I might say hey. But you shouldn't worry (ha ha) about what they say. 'Cause they got nothin' on you baby. Nothin' on you baby. Yeah. Yeah (ha ha). And that's just how we do it (ha ha ha). And I'mma just let this ride. B.o.B and Bruno Mars.
