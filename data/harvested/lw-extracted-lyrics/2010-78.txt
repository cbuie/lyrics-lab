Moment of honesty, Someones gotta take the lead tonight. Whose it gonna be? I'm gonna sit right here and tell u while it comes to me. If u have something to say. You should say it right now. (You should say it right now). You give me a feeling that I never felt before. And I deserve it, I know I deserve it. Its become something that's impossible to ignore. And I can't take it. I was wondering maybe. Could I make you my baby. If we do the unthinkable will it make us look crazy. If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready). If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready). I know u said to me. This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be. Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually. If we gonna do something about it. We should do it right now. (We should do it right now). You give me a feeling that I never felt before. And I deserve it, I know I deserve it. Its become something that's impossible to ignore. Its what we make it. I was wondering maybe. Could I make you my baby. If we do the unthinkable. Will it make us look crazy. Or would it be so beautiful. Either way I'm sayin. If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready). If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready). Sayin. I give up before we try. Feel the lows before the highs. Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away). I can't say I can't compare. I'm suspended it the air. Won't u come be in the sky with me. I was wondering maybe. Could I make you my baby. If we do the unthinkable. Will it make us look crazy. Or would it be so beautiful. Either way I'm sayin. If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready). If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready). If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready). If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready).
