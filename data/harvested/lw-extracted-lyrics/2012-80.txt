Drinking a German beer with a Cuban cigar. In the middle of Paris with a Dominican bar. Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad. She transferred to Harvard from King’s College in March. She says that I’m her favorite cause she admires the art. Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars. She’s well put together like a piece by Gershwin. Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect. So smile, and pack your bags real good baby. 'Cause you’ll be gone for a while, while while. Girl tell me how you feel. What your fantasy? I see us on a beach down in Mexico. You can put your feet up. Be my señorita. We ain’t gotta rush. Just take it slow. You’ll be in the high life. Soaking up the sunlight. Anything you want is yours. I had you living life like you should. You say you never had it so good. La la-la la-la la-laaa. You never had it so good. La la-la la-la la-laaa. Suffering from first class cabin fever. Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt. I’m to the point like the pyramids of Giza. Still lean to the left like the tower out in Pisa. I’m feeling single baby. I could use a feature. Swagger like Ceaser, I’ll get you a visa. We can go to Italy, and maybe see the Colosseum. I’ll be da Vinci if you’ll be my Mona Lisa. So smile, and pack your bags real good baby. 'Cause you’ll be gone for a while. La la-la la-la la-laaa. You never had it so good. La la-la la-la la-laaa. Well I been feeling singular. How about let’s make it plural? Spin the globe, wherever it lands that’s where we’ll go. We’ll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some euros. And maybe visit Berlin, the wall’s with the murals. This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo. Private reservations, glasses full of merlot. A rose, a burgundy, travel like turbo. Brush up on your Español. We’ll Barcelona bounce. So smile, and pack your bags real good baby. 'Cause you’ll be gone for a while. La la-la la-la la-laaa. You never had it so good. La la-la la-la la-laaa. La la-la la-la la-laaa. You never had it so good. La la-la la-la la-laaa. La la-la la-la la-laaa. You never had it so good. La la-la la-la la-laaa. La la-la la-la la-laaa. You never had it so good. La la-la la-la la-laaa. La la-la la-la la-laaa. You never had it so good. La la-la la-la la-laaa.
