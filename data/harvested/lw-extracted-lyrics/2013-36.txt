. Ask for money and get advice. Ask for advice, get money twice. I'm from the Dirty but that chico nice. Y'all call it a moment, I call it life. One day when the light is glowing. I'll be in my castle golden. But until the gates are open. I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh). I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh). I just wanna feel this moment. Mr. Worldwide. Christina Aguilera. Oye mamita, (I just wanna feel this moment) come on, dale. Que la cosa esta rica. Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo. Long ways from the hard ways.

Baby we can travel the world. And not given view and all you can see. Time is money. Only difference is I own it. Like a stopwatch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment. One day when the light is glowing. I'll be in my castle golden. But until the gates are open. I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh). I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh). I just wanna feel this moment. (Ohhh) I just wanna feel this moment. (Ohhh) I just wanna feel this moment.
