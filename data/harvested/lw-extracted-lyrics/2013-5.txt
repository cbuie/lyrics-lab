Alright, okay. Alright, okay. Alright, okay. Return of the Mack, get up. What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't. Looking for a better way to get up out of bed. Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit. We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking. Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious. Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, Sweater Gang. Nope, nope, y'all can't copy. Yup, bad, moonwalkin', this here, is our party. My posse's been on Broadway and we did it our way. Grown music. I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it. And yet I'm on. Let that stage light go and shine on down. Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style. Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds. But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town. Trust me, I'm a I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler. Chasing dreams since I was fourteen. With the four track, busing halfway cross that city with the backpack. Fat cat crushin', labels out here. Nah they can't tell me nothing, we give that to the people. Spread it across the country, labels out here. Nah they can't tell me nothing, we give it to the people. Spread it across the country. Can we go back, this is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. Can we go back, this is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. Now, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful. I grew up really wanting gold fronts. But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you. Y'all can't stop me. I go hard like I've got an 808 in my heartbeat. And I'm eating at the beat. Like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week. (Raw! Time to go off. Gone)? Deuces, goodbye. I've got a world to see;. And my girl, she wanna see Rome. Caesar'll make you a believer. Nah, I never ever did it for a throne. That validation comes. So I'm giving it back to the people now. Sing that song and it goes like. Raise those hands, this is our party. We came here to live life like nobody was watching. I got my city right behind me. If I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure, gain humility. And then we keep marching, I said. Can we go back, this is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. Can we go back, this is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. Oh, oh, oh. "Na na nana na nana na.". Hey, and all my people say. "Na na nana na nana na.". Hey, and all my people say. "Na na nana na nana na.". Oh, and all my people say. "Na na nana na nana na.". Mack-le-more. Can we go back, this is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. Can we go back, this is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us.
