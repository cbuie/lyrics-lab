I don't like walkin' around this old and empty house. The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keepin' me awake. And some days I can't even dress myself. 'Cause though the truth may vary. This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore. There's an old voice in my head that's holdin' me back. Soon it will be over and buried with our past. Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right. 'Cause though the truth may vary. This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore. Don't listen to a word I say. The screams all sound the same. Though the truth may vary. This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore. You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear. All that's left is a ghost of you. Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothin' we can do. Just let me go, we'll meet again soon. Now, wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around. I'll see you when I fall asleep. Don't listen to a word I say. The screams all sound the same. Though the truth may vary. This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore. Don't listen to a word I say. The screams all sound the same. Though the truth may vary. This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore. Though the truth may vary. This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore. Though the truth may vary. This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore.
