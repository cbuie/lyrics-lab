In the beginning, I never thought it would be you. When we were chillin', smilin' in the photo booth. But we got closer, till you were eatin' off my spoon. And coming over and we would talk all afternoon. Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace. Bind your hands all over me and then you bite your lip. Whisper and say, "We're goin' all the way". Tonight, take me to the other side. Sparks fly like the Fourth of July. Just take me to the other side. I see that sexy look in your eyes. And I know, we ain't friends anymore. If we walk down this road we'll be lovers for sure. So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die. And take me to the other side. This could be perfect but we won't know unless we try. I know you're nervous, so just sit back and let me drive. Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace. Bind your hands all over me and then you bite your lip. Whisper and say, "We're goin' all the way". Tonight, take me to the other side. Sparks fly like the Fourth of July. Just take me to the other side. I see that sexy look in your eyes. And I know, we ain't friends anymore. If we walk down this road we'll be lovers for sure. So tonight kiss me like it's do or die. And take me to the other side. Kiss me like it's do or die. And take me to the other side. Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace. Let your love crash into me and then you bite your lip. Whisper and say, "We're goin' all the way". Tonight, take me to the other side. Sparks fly like the Fourth of July. Just take me to the other side. I see that sexy look in your eyes. And I know, we ain't friends anymore. If we walk down this road we'll be lovers for sure. So tonight, tonight, kiss me like it's do or die. And take me to the other side. Take me to the other side. And take me to the other side. Kiss me like it's do or die. And take me to the other side.
