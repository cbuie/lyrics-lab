__TF was really busy trying to coordinate all teams. With the Thanksgiving Holiday fast approaching we offered the following proposition:__

Brian,
We went ahead and ended our hangout. Were you held up in another team meeting again? With the holidays fast approaching, it is going to be much harder to meet. As an immediate example, I am travelling starting tomorrow.  

Our progress and key focuses (which are refined from the initial proposal):
Our project is being managed under GitHub, it is public as directed, see https://github.com/michaeljohns/lyrics-lab.
We will use GitHub Pages for the final website, see https://github.com/michaeljohns/lyrics-lab/tree/gh-pages for ongoing implementation.
We have our data conditioned and ready for further processing, see our draft master notebook highlights at https://github.com/michaeljohns/lyrics-lab/blob/master/notebooks/master.ipynb (other exploratory notebooks exist elsewhere on the site).
We are finalizing core NLP processing into n-grams, vocabs and similar (internal deadline imposed for early this week), also partially captured in master notebook linked earlier.
We are already exploring various latent clustering methods, including those used in hw5 as well as a separate ensemble approach using Spark ML.
We will be focusing on per decade similarities and differences
We also want to predict how a particular song, e.g. a current hit not in the existing corpus, might perform in a given decade and/or genre from our fit corpus.
We will be focusing heavily on the story telling aspect to highlight interesting results.

As a team we are willing to forego actually meeting with you given the impending holiday and will gratefully accept your feedback over email. However, if you still want to meet via Google Hangout, the entire team may not be able to attend. If you are ok with virtually green-lighting the project, would you be willing to offer us some bullet point guidance over email regarding any areas of focus you would like use to strongly consider?  Thank you for guiding our team's final project.
