    "* how many existing lyrics were preserved?  43, meaning the initially provided lyrics proved more useful in these instances.\n",
    "* how many lyric_abstract were used?  61, meaning the harvested abstracts from lyrics.wikia api metatdata were the best available (first 280 characters)\n",
    "* how many lyrics are invalid (after other rules)?  103, meaning these are empty after automated processing.\n",
