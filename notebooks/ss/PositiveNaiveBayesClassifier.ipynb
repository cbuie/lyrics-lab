    "## Positive Naive Bayes Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "A song can fit in more than one genre, and our conditioning of the data has been attentive to preserving the one-to-potentially-many relationship. In this part, a classifier develops a probability that a given body of text will fit within each of the top ten selected genres. It uses the nltk positive naive Bayes classifier to train a set of lyrics for each of the top 15 genres, using 80% of the data. It assigns uniform priors at various levels, then priors based on the relative frequency of songs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process builds 15 distinct, independent classifiers, and then chooses a randome sentence from each song in the testing set, submitting it to each classifier, which returns True if the classifier predicts that the sentence is a member of the associated genre, and False otherwise. Thus, any body of text submitted to it could result in a prediction of zero, one, or up to 15 genre memberships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers of true and false positives and negatives are accumulated, and the results are expressed as (true positives plus true negatives) / total observations.  To test whether the classifiers comport with our subjective understanding of what sentences are likey to be in which genres of music, at the end of the notebook the classifers are exposed to entry of arbitrary text which returns the predicted genre(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process does not use cross-validation because the nltk PositiveNaiveBayesClassifier does not expose any regularization parameters; the only parameter it accepts is a prior. The theoretically most appropriate prior to use for each genre is the genre's relative frequency in  the training set; the classifier is run against the testing set using other values for the prior only to gauge whether the theoretically chosen prior is at least as good as arbitrarily chosen values. The series of procedures suggest that it is.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### The real value of this classfier battery, however, is in how it performs in action, assessed subjectively.  To enter arbitrary text and see what (if any) genres it matches, run this notebook (Cell->Run All) and then go to the last cell.  The classifier battery takes about ten minutes to train, but then each text input is processed very quickly. "

    "The choice of prior had influence on the results. With higher priors, the model had the greatest success in matching songs to their genres, but also overdid it considerably. False positives outnumbered true positives for every prior value, but the margin was much more for larger priors.   Very small priors bias the classifiers more toward the negative side, so far fewer matches were predicted, and the true negatives dominated. This is to be expected since each genre only has a small probability of being applicable to a selected song. \n",
    "\n",
    "Genre-specific priors were calculated by counting the number of songs in each genre, divided by the total number of songs, and multiplying that times the average probability of any one genre, 435 total genres divided by 4500 songs. Using the variable prior yielded the best results of all, correct 86.6% of the time and with results that made sense in light of experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfoprtunately, none of the models beat the simple classification baseline approach of just predicting negative each time. Part of the reason for this is the model selection- this process does not predict which of the genres are most likely; rather it independently predicts whether a sentence is likely to come from a given genre.  This was initially believed necessary to accommodate the one-to-many nature of the song-to-genre relation. But the result was to have a very low probability that the song would fit into each genre individually, thus making the data quite unbalanced in favor of negative results.  On the other hand, as the cells below indicate, when the classifier does prdict one or a small number of genres for a given text, it seems to be apt.   "
