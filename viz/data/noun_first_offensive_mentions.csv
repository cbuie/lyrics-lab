Ready to make an entrance so back on up. ('Cause you know we're about to rip shit up). Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble. Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble. Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby. Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy. Death Row is the label that pays me. Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah). But um, back to the lecture at hand. Perfection is perfected so I'mma let 'em understand. From a young G's perspective. And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive. You never know, she could be earning her man. And learning her man and at the same time burning her man. Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant. Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah). And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield. And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel. Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk. I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff. It's like this and like that and like this and uh. It's like that and like this and like that and uh. It's like this and like that and like this and uh. (Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom). Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in. But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beeping. Now it's time for me to make my impression felt. So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt. You never been on a ride like this before. With a producer who can rap and control the maestro. At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick. You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit. To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope. Take a toke but don't choke. If you do, you'll have no clue. On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do. It's like this and like that and like this and uh. It's like that and like this and like that and uh. It's like this and who gives a fuck about those? (So just chill till the next episode). Falling back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean. Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens. It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N-double O-P. D-O-double G-Y, D-O-double G, ya see. Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic. Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite. Yeah, and it don't quit. I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah). So Dre (What up Dogg?). Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?). We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah). And it's gotta be bumping, city of Compton. Is where it takes place so when asked, your attention. Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching. Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble. When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble. Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked. My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back. Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slipping. But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping. And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down. And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down. Yeah and you don't stop. I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock. But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn. C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach. Putting the shit together. Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better. Like this, that, this and uh. It's like that and like this and like that and uh. It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
